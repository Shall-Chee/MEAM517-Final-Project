# Multi-Robot Coverage Control from Time-Varing Density Map

• Reformulated coverage objective, encoded by locational cost, based on given time-varying density map.

• Improved path planning algorithms to avoid local minimum by adding exponentially decaying term.

• Developed decentralized coverage controller to achieve centroidal Voronoi tessellation based on Lloyd Algorithm.
