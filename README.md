## MEAM 517 Final Project

Reformulated coverage objective, encoded by a locational cost, based on given time-varing density map.

Improved path planning algorithms to avoid local minimum by adding exponentially decaying term.

Developed decentralized coverage controllers to achieve centroidal Voronoi tessellations based on Lloyd Algorithm.
